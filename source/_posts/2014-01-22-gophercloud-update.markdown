I'm happy to report that Gophercloud has received some contributor interest
recently. I wanted to drop a quick update to keep everyone up to date about
the continued growth and changes to [Gophercloud](http://gophercloud.io/).

<!--more-->

In particular, Gophercloud now supports Rackspace API Keys for authentication.
The publicly-visible interface for using API keys follows the conventions set
previously by the `AuthOptions` structure, this means the *interface* should
work with any provider that supports API keys.

In terms of implementation, it only works with Rackspace for now. We definitely
welcome contributions, even only feature-requests from others who'd like to
see this work with other providers. More feedback from everyone will help us
grow!

We've also received several contributions for its Cloud Files support over the
past several days.

While the Cloud Files API remains in flux, for it's still very new, we broke
ground and we're hammering the details out now. We won't merge to master
until we have an API we're happy with; however, folks interested in exercising
the new API can do so by changing to the `cloud-files` topic branch.
Interested in helping out?  Join us today and leave your mark!

What's coming down the pike?

Version 0.1.0 will introduce support for arbitrary fixed and floating IP
pool names, as well as support for security groups.

As I write this, we're closing in at 50% complete for v0.1.0.
Looking forward, it looks like version 0.1.1 will support a more complete images API.

Perhaps most significantly, we're looking at refreshing the API completely for
v0.2.0.

We're finding the current API design just isn't scalable along the axes we'd
like.

* First, it's taking longer and longer to run tests, and we'd like to reduce the time taken.
* It's nearly impossible for every user to run every test against their provider of choice,
as few providers support all available extensions to OpenStack.
* Running the current set of tests requires you have an account through a real
OpenStack provider, which costs you money. (it should not cost the user real money to test a package).
* Finally, adding support for OpenStack extensions yields messy code.

If you remember the good ol' days with Windows 3.1 and its heavily overloaded
`WINDOWS` directory, that's not entirely dissimilar to what's happening with
Gophercloud's package layout, data structures, and interfaces in versions 0.1.x.

The v0.2.0 API will address these issues thanks to a new package hierarchy layout,
a complete refactoring of the request/response phases, and extensive use of
the virtually forgotten Carrier-Rider design pattern, which happens to apply
nicely for our needs.

As usual, if anyone wishes to contribute to the project, we'd love to see you
on our [developers group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gophercloud-dev).

For those who have already contributed, I thank you deeply!
