Rackspace has just launched Cloud Images, a public OpenStack Images API v2 endpoint in the Rackspace open cloud.  Why should you care?  Well, this product is interesting to developers for several reasons.

First, Cloud Images is API only at this point, so there's an opportunity to create interfaces and tools to facilitate use of Cloud Images itself.

Second, Cloud Images opens the possibility for developers to create new virtual machine images for other Rackspace cloud users.  You can create these inside our cloud and share them, or you can create them outside our cloud and then (as long as they're prepared properly) import them into our cloud.

Check out our Cloud Images FAQ to get an overview of the product and what it can do.  You can find it at http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/frequently-asked-questions-about-using-glance-and-the-images-api

Once you want to start coding, you can find the API documentation at http://docs.rackspace.com/images/api/v2/ci-devguide/content/index.html
