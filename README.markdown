## How to contribute to the blog

**If you use Vagrant**: <https://github.com/raxdevblog/vagrant-blog>

Otherwise, there are several ways to contribute:

###Fork/Pull Request Method

1. Fork the repo, clone your fork to your local machine
2. Install Ruby with RVM: `$ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails --autolibs=enabled --ruby=1.9.3`
3. In the `devsite` directory, run `bundle install`.
4. In the same directory, create a new post: `rake new_post['The title of your post']`
5. Edit the file that is created. See section below on how to write articles.
6. Be sure to leave "published: false" on your post so we can schedule content for posting.
7. Check your work with `rake generate && rake preview` (You can reach it at http://localhost:4000)
8. [Submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) with your new post

###Gist/Issue Method

Create a private [gist](https://gist.github.com/) or your post in Markdown format and submit an issue [here](https://github.com/rackerlabs/devsite/issues).

**Writing articles**

* Posts are created in `/source/_posts` and are written in Markdown. [Here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is a format guide for Markdown.
* Images should be placed in `/source/images`. Read [here](http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/image-tag/) on how to use the img tag in your posts.
* Posts with YouTube Videos: `{% youtube 12345678 %}` where "12345678" is the video ID.
